# Overview
Consistent code reviews ensure code quality, can aid in identifying potential 
issues early, and improve overall code. Additionally, code reviews provide an 
opportunity to learn from each other, improve coding skills, increase your 
confidence in your code, and enhance your ability to discuss code in formal and 
informal settings. Everyone in our lab should be involved in code reviews. This 
document provides general documentation for performing informal lab code review 
(code review at the coderâ€™s request), lab meeting code review, and manuscript 
submission code review. In addition, a resource section is provided to point 
lab members to style guides, R packages that can help automate portions of code 
review, and other helpful resources.
