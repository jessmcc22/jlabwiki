# Overview
## What are code reviews?

Regular code reviews are essential for maintaining high-quality code. They help identify potential issues early, improve overall code structure, and promote best practices. Code reviews are also valuable learning opportunities—they allow you to:

- Learn from others' approaches and feedback
  
- Improve your coding skills
  
- Build confidence in your code
  
- Practice communicating about code in both formal and informal contexts
  

**Everyone in the lab is encouraged to participate in code reviews!**

## A guide to code reviews

This guide outlines how to conduct different types of code reviews in our lab:

- Informal code reviews – requested by the coder at any stage
  
- Lab meeting code reviews – collaborative reviews during lab meetings
  
- Manuscript submission reviews – final checks before submitting code with a manuscript
  

You'll also find a resources section with:

- Recommended style guides
  
- Useful R packages for automating parts of the review process
  
- Additional materials to support effective code reviews
