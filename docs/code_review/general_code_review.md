# General Guidelines

## For the Developer
To enable a successful code review, the developer should provide the reviewer(s) 
with:
-	A written description of the Goal/Objective of the Code
-	A written description of all inputs 
-	Provide a sample input/dataset
-	The code (150-200 lines of code at a time)

## For the Reviewer
The reviewer should:
- Expect to spend about 1 hour per 200 lines of code
- Evaluate the code in the following ways:
    - Does the output meet the stated goal and does it run successfully?
    - Is the code well commented?
    - Is there repeated code that could be eliminated through use of a function?
    - Are there any functions or methods you know of that could improve 
    efficiency?
    - Is the code readable?
    - Are there edge cases that should be considered or checks that should be 
    created (especially important if others will use the code)?
    - What did you learn from the code that you would use in the future?
- Provide a written summary including constructive feedback AND positive praise
- Provide prompt review (Developer is unlikely to move forward without feedback)

## Feedback Format
- Completely Virtual:
    - Developer provides code file and data file (or code/location of data)
    - Reviewer provides a written document in return, like a manuscript review
    - Agree upon an expected turnaround time
- Hybrid:
    - Reviewer provides real-time comments w/written notes on needed changes
    - Ideally:
        - Developer and Review choose a meeting day and time (Ex: Wed 3pm)
        - Code is provided end of business day 2 days before the meeting (Mon)
        - Meeting occurs, feedback can be discussed, outstanding issues are 
        directly shared in written format

# Setting Specific Expectations
The general guidelines outlined above can and should be adapted based on the
type of review being completed. Lab members are expected to routinely be 
involved in informal, lab meeting, and manuscript reviews. Additional details 
and modifications for each of these settings are outlined in the locations
below:

- [Informal Code Review](code_review/informal_code_review.md)
- [Lab Meeting Code Review](code_review/lab_meeting_code_review.md)
- [Manuscript Submission Code Review](code_review/manuscript_code_review.md)
