# Informal Code Review
Informal code reviews occur as needed by individuals within their assigned pods.
As a general guideline, informal code reviews should at least be utilized when 
an individual has added a new feature to a package or analysis or when an 
individual has been dealing with a bug for an extended period (more than a few 
hours/a day). Individuals are encouraged to use pod meetings to hold reviews, 
but may also schedule time outside of these meetings and/or use Slack. Pods 
working on more code-heavy projects (package creation, analyses) may choose (or 
be asked) to incorporate lab reviews into their weekly structure.
