# Informal Code Reviews

Informal code reviews are conducted as needed within each assigned pod.

## When to Initiate a Review

As a general guideline, informal code reviews should be considered in the following situations:

- When a new feature has been added to a package or analysis.
- When someone has been troubleshooting a bug for an extended period (e.g., more than a few hours or a full day).

## Where to Conduct Reviews

- Pod meetings are a great opportunity to hold informal code reviews.
- Reviews can also be scheduled outside of regular pod meetings.
- Slack may be used to coordinate or conduct quick reviews.

## Additional Note
Pods working on code-intensive projects (such as package development or complex 
analyses) are encouraged—and may be required—to include code reviews as a 
regular part of their weekly workflow.
