# Lab Meeting Code Review

## An Abbreviated Code Reviews

Abbreviated code reviews conducted during lab meetings are designed to be lightweight and require no advance preparation from reviewers.

### Format

- One presenter per lab meeting will share either:
  - Their scientific work, or
  - A helpful topic, along with relevant code.
- The presenter leads the session, walking through their code and explaining its context.

### Purpose

- These sessions are meant to provide focused, constructive feedback.
- Given the limited time, presenters are encouraged to **request specific feedback areas** (see [Suggested Reviewer Feedback](#) for examples).

### Guidelines for Presenters

- Code shared often relates to previously discussed scientific topics, but is not a requirement.
- Choose code where feedback will be most beneficial to your work.

## Structure
- 10-10:30: Intros/Ice Breaker
- 10:30-10:45: Present Science (or other topic helpful to presenter)
- 10:45-10:55: Q&A (based on science/chosen topic)
- 10:55-11:00: Presenter Introduces Code
    - Expected Output/Goal
    - Describe the Inputs
    - Provide code
    - Optional: Provide Example Input
- 11:00-11:10: Independent Review of Presenter’s Code
    - Will likely have time to evaluate code in 1 or 2 of the ways suggested 
    earlier
- 11:10-11:20: Presenter Walks through Code
    - Describe the logic behind each line or chunk of lines
    - Describe algorithms, function calls, etc
- 11:20-11:30: Code Feedback
    - Send specific “to-dos” or changes to the developer via Slack OR as issues on GitHub
    - Provide positive praise (may be done via chat)
