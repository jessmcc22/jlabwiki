# Lab Meeting Code Review
This abbreviated code review will not require outside preparation on the
reviewers’ side. A single presenter will present their science (or helpful 
topic) and their code in each lab meeting. Due to the shortened nature of the 
review, the presenter/developer may ask for specific feedback (see suggested 
reviewer feedback above) for the reviewers to focus their comments on. The code 
presented in the meeting often aligns with the previously discussed science; 
however, this need not always be the case. Like all lab meeting topics, 
presenters should choose to present code in which feedback will most benefit 
the presenter.

## Structure
- 10-10:30: Intros/Ice Breaker
- 10:30-10:45: Present Science (or other topic helpful to presenter)
- 10:45-10:55: Q&A (based on science/chosen topic)
- 10:55-11:00: Presenter Introduces Code
    - Expected Output/Goal
    - Describe the Inputs
    - Provide code
    - Optional: Provide Example Input
- 11:00-11:10: Independent Review of Presenter’s Code
    - Will likely have time to evaluate code in 1 or 2 of the ways suggested 
    earlier
- 11:10-11:20: Presenter Walks through Code
    - Describe the logic behind each line or chunk of lines
    - Describe algorithms, function calls, etc
- 11:20-11:30: Code Feedback
    - Send specific “to-dos” or changes to the developer via Slack OR as issues on GitHub
    - Provide positive praise (may be done via chat)
