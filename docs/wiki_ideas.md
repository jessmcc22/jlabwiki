# Wiki Ideas

The goal is to grow this wiki into a collection of tutorials and information that is highly relevant to our lab.

Please add topics that you would like to see on the wiki! Vague ideas are ok

## Ideas
 - Add jessica's code review doc (in MD format)
 - Aubrey - intro to Bioconductor package development
 - How to write effective R code
 - Links to lab posters
 - List of working J Lab R Packages
 - Recommended tools for various Bioinfo analyses
