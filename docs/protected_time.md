# Evan's Protected Lab Time

*New as of Summer 2025!*

Evan has carved out PROTECTED time on Tuesdays and Thursdays to meet with students and Pod groups. Your weekly meeting with him will be **either** a Pods meeting (60 minutes) or a one-on-one (45 minutes).

All meetings will be canceled during travel weeks, and the rotation will resume the following week.

You can access the most up-to-date dates and times here: [Evan's Schedule.xlsx](https://rutgersconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/jkm186_njms_rutgers_edu/EfCToA2Q57lKlzBCqEMvYjcBpeSDOE33O73XwiJFhy7wMw?e=20ied3)

Be sure to send Evan your Zoom link information and a calendar invite for your meetings if it is not already on your calendar.

## Timeliness

- If you can get feedback or discuss something via Slack or email, consider doing that to reserve more of your meeting time for other topics.

- Evan can sometimes be a tad late! Some helpful tips:
  
    - Reach out to him on Slack (and via cell if urgent)
    
    - Please be aware of time during your slot! 
    
        - If you started the meeting late, you can send a quick slack to the next individual or group to let them know of the delay.
        
        - Be mindful of going over your time slot. Also remind Evan if need be :)

- Sometimes when Evan is traveling, he doesn't always relay that a meeting needs to be canceled until day-of.
  
    - Try sending him a message on Slack ahead of time with your agenda. If he can't meet, it'll probably remind him to tell you he can't.
