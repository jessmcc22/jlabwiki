# Lab Retreat 2025

*See Slack for more finite details as we continue to plan!*

Here's the deets:

WHEN: Saturday, August 2 (8/2)

WHERE: Newark area, NJ

WHO: The Johnson Lab

WHAT: RETREAT!
- Hike
- Group photo
- BYO picnic lunch
- Unstructured time / small group activities (e.g. escape room, hanging out, climbing)
- Dinner with the lab (restaurant, pay for yourself)

WHY: Because we deserve some in-person hangout time with each other after working remotely day-in and day-out!

We are eager to hear ideas on hike locations and other ideas, which we can solidify as we get closer. We will also get carpooling logistics figured out.
For now, please mark August 2nd in your calendars!
