## **Johnson Lab Expectations**

### Culture
##### 1. Support a Positive and Inclusive Lab Culture
We enthusiastically value diversity, inclusion, and kindness. Be mindful of 
others’ perspectives and help create a welcoming and rewarding environment for 
everyone.

##### 2. Engage Fully in Lab Meetings
Attend all scheduled lab meetings and actively participate. These gatherings are
a space to present your work, listen to others, ask thoughtful questions, and
learn from your peers. They also help foster a sense of community in our remote
setting. Your presence matters!!! Please make sure to let Evan know beforehand
if you need to miss a lab meeting.

##### 3. Camera On During Ice Breakers
We love seeing your face during our ice breaker sessions! Sharing fun facts and
stories helps us connect on a personal level and build trust within the team. We
understand that there may be times when you can’t connect (technical issues, 
internet bandwidth, etc), but this should be the exception, not the rule. Please
make every effort to be present and visible at this time.  

  
### Function
##### 1. Participate Actively in Your Pod
Your pod group is a small, focused team of 3-4 labmates where you’ll collaborate
on projects, engage in discussions relevant to your work, and build deeper
relationships with peers. You will meet each week for about an hour to share
progress and ask for or provide support. Please take these assignments
seriously; they have been thoughtfully and purposefully designed–you have a role
to play!

Pods help you engage with others’ projects, get support on your own, and build
collaborations that can lead to co-authorship while strengthening individual
work, your peers’ work, and our lab culture.

##### 2. Stay Organized and Prepared
Come to meetings prepared, keep track of your tasks, and manage your time 
effectively. This helps you contribute meaningfully and stay aligned with lab
goals.

##### 3. Success is Measured by Productivity
We love our remote work model! It gives us the freedom to think big, work smart,
and enjoy life outside the lab. But with great flexibility comes great
responsibility! Be honest about your effort and remember the time commitment you
agreed to when joining the lab.

Ultimately, success is measured by productivity, most visibly via published
papers, grants, and forward momentum on projects. Our remote work model only
works as well as we can stay accountable and productive. Be mindful of which
projects are funding your work, so you can make appropriate progress on these
efforts, but also keep in mind that yours and others’ future in the lab is
dependent on our ability to fund future projects. So your progress and efforts
play a significant role in our ability to succeed together!

Goals to keep in mind:
- Postdocs and research scientists: Aim to publish two first-author papers per
  year.  
- Students: Shoot for one first-author publication per year.  
- In addition to first author papers, you should be involved in multiple
  collaborative papers, either within the lab or with external collaborators.
  Students should have clearly defined Aims and Thesis goals, but the lines for
  postdocs and research scientists are more blurry – make every effort to engage
  with others to make your (and their) work better!  
- These targets might shift depending on other assignments (Evan will let you
  know if that’s the case).  

**_Bottom line:_** we’re here to do great science and enjoy the ride. Let’s keep the
momentum going!  

  
### Expectations
##### 1. Regular 1:1 Meetings with Evan
These 45-minute meetings are your opportunity for personalized guidance,
feedback, and mentorship and typically occur every other week. It is your
responsibility to make sure these meetings are scheduled and on Evan’s
wejlab@gmail.com calendar (send a calendar invite).  

Please be patient if Evan is running late. He gives each meeting his full
attention, and you’ll receive that same thoughtful focus during your own meeting.

##### 2. Be Proactive and Accountable
Take initiative in your work and follow through on commitments. If you're facing
challenges or delays on an assignment after using the tools available to you,
communicate early so you can be supported by your Pod, other members with
previous experience in your work and Evan. If you are unable to attend a meeting
or will be late, let those in attendance know as soon as possible so that they
can plan accordingly.

##### 3. Ask for Help
Don’t wait for your next one-on-one or Pod meeting to ask for help, especially
if it prevents you from doing further work! Reach out via Slack on appropriate
channels or via direct message to those people who are best suited to help you.
If you are uncertain where to turn, try a general channel like `#coding` or 
`#johnson-lab` before turning directly to Evan. 

As a rule of thumb, more than 30 minutes on a coding challenge without progress
is a sign to switch gears to a different assignment, before returning with fresh
eyes and trying again. After an hour of honest work, reach out for additional
support!

##### 4. Conduct Rigorous Science
As you are working on projects, presenting results, submitting grants, and
publishing papers, strive for the highest quality of science possible. 

This includes:  
- Being familiar with best practices within the field  
- Utilizing style guides  
- Making your work publicly available and reproducible  
- Engaging in proofreading and having your work reviewed by Pod/lab members  
- Requesting work-in-progress code reviews and final code reviews  
- Acknowledging individuals, tools, and the work of others in your own work  
- Creating visually appealing and informative figures  

The lab wiki contains information on how to accomplish many of these tasks, but
please reach out to others for assistance as needed, especially on first-time
attempts.

  
### Conclusion
Failure to consistently meet these expectations may result in a range of
consequences, including but not limited to formal warnings, reduced
responsibilities, impact on authorship or funding opportunities, and, in some
cases, dismissal from the lab.
