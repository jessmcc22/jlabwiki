### **Johnson Lab Expectations**

1. **Engage Fully in Lab Meetings**  
   Attend all scheduled lab meetings and actively participate. These 
   gatherings are a space to present your work, listen to others, ask 
   thoughtful questions, and learn from your peers. They also help foster a
   sense of community in our remote setting. Your presence matters!!

2. **Turn Your Camera On During Ice Breakers**  
   We love seeing your face during our ice breaker sessions! Sharing fun 
   facts and stories helps us connect on a personal level and build trust 
   within the team.

3. **Participate Actively in Your Pod Group**  
   Your pod group is a smaller, focused team where you’ll collaborate on 
   projects, engage in discussions relevant to your work, and build deeper 
   relationships with peers. Regular participation strengthens both your 
   work and our lab culture.

4. **Maintain Regular One-on-One Meetings with Evan**  
   These meetings are your opportunity for personalized guidance, feedback,
   and mentorship. Please be patient if Evan is running late... he gives each
   meeting his full attention, and you’ll receive that same thoughtful 
   focus during your own meeting.

5. **Be Proactive and Accountable**  
   Take initiative in your work and follow through on commitments. If 
   you're facing challenges or delays, communicate early so we can support 
   you.

6. **Support a Positive and Inclusive Lab Culture**  
   We value diversity, inclusion, and kindness. Be mindful of others’ 
   perspectives and help create a welcoming environment for everyone.

7. **Stay Organized and Prepared**  
   Come to meetings prepared, keep track of your tasks, and manage your 
   time effectively. This helps you contribute meaningfully and stay 
   aligned with lab goals.
