# Welcome

Hello! Welcome to my humble internet abode.

I’m currently a postdoc in the Kolachalama lab. I have a MS in statistics and a PhD in bioinformatics. I am interested in the intersection of cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders, which intersects with the focus of my T32 postdoctoral fellowship in cardiovascular epidemiology. I aspire to join academia and am working towards submitting a career development K award this fall.

I'm an expert in microbiome analysis and profiling methods. I've also performed gene expression analyses and worked with single-cell RNA-seq data.

What I’m up to currently:

- Working on a variety of projects with Kolachalama lab and the [Johnson lab](http://wejlab.org) (my PhD lab which now resides at Rutgers University).
- Writing grants.
- Mentoring students in the Johnson lab.
