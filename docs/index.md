## The Johnson Lab Wiki

This is a **collaborative** knowledge base for members of the W. Evan Johnson Lab
at Rutgers University.

This wiki is built using MkDocs. Check out [this guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) 
for a detailed introduction on how to navigate and edit the wiki via Github.

If you have ideas on how to improve the wiki or about new content you would like to be added, 
write something on the "Wiki Ideas" page.
