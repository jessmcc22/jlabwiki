# Lab Meeting

Lab meeting is held on Thursdays from 10-11:30 AM Eastern. To join, log onto Evan’s Zoom meeting (See Slack for link).

## Instructions for presenters
Lab meetings are assigned according to a rotation schedule of lab members ordered by topic.
All lab members are assigned a topic that best reflects their research.

Ice breakers can be anything that gets people having fun or getting to know each other better.
They can take up to 15-20 minutes. Be creative!

Presenters can speak on any topic they choose, although the rotation schedule is based on their primary research topic.
Presenters should shoot for ~15 minutes followed by ~10. minutes for questions and discussion.

Note: If you don’t have any research updates, please present a paper in your field that is of interest to you and/or others in the lab!

Presenters should also prepare for a short code review after presenting on their
science topic. The code review should include a 5 min intro to the code, 10
minutes for lab members to review the code indepently, 10 min code walk through,
and 10 minutes for feedback/questions. More information can be found on the
[Lab Meeting Code Review](code_review/lab_meeting_code_review) page.
