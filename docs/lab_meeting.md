# Lab Meeting

Lab meeting is held on Thursdays from 10-11:30 AM Eastern. To join, log onto Evan’s Zoom meeting (See Slack for link).

## Instructions for presenters
Lab meetings are assigned according to a rotation schedule of lab members ordered by topic.
All lab members are assigned a topic that best reflects their research.

Ice breakers can be anything that gets people having fun or getting to know each other better.
They can take up to 15-20 minutes. Be creative!

Presenters can speak on any topic they choose, although the rotation schedule is based on their primary research topic.
Presenters should shoot for ~30 minutes. There will be separate time allotted for questions and discussion.

Note: If you don’t have any research updates, please present a paper in your field that is of interest to you and/or others in the lab!
