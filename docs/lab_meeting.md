# Lab Meeting

Lab meeting is held on Thursdays from 10-11:30 AM Eastern. To join, log onto Evan’s Zoom meeting (See Slack for link).

## Instructions for presenters
Lab meetings are assigned according to a rotation schedule of lab members.
Your presentation should focus on your most relevant projects/research, including code review.

Ice breakers can be anything that gets people having fun or getting to know each other better.
They can take up to 15-20 minutes. Be creative!

Presenters can speak on any topic they choose, although typically should focus on your primary research topic.
Presenters should shoot for ~10-15 minute presentation followed by ~5 minutes for questions and discussion.

Note: If you don’t have any research updates, please present a paper in your field that is of interest to you and/or others in the lab!

## Presenter Code Review
Presenters should also prepare for a short code review after presenting on their
science topic. 

The code review should include a ~5 min intro to the code, ~10 minutes for lab
members to review the code independently, and ~5 minutes for feedback/questions. 

More information can be found on the
[Lab Meeting Code Review](code_review/code_review_overview.md) page.

Ultimately, use these 30 minutes in the way that will be most helpful to you. What would you like feedback on? If you have a longer presentation coming up that you would like to practice for, we can schedule more time for you!
